# Krill Kam Updates

Howdy wanna see the krill kam grow? 

Check out the updates below! :eyes::shrimp: [^1]
[^1]: I've spent 10 hours total on this project so far ðŸ˜º

## May 16th: Sketching
Got in a rough idea of what I want the Camcorder to look like. It is based off the Sony Handy Cam that I have at home.

## May 17th: First CAD & Print
Today I was just creating the Basic CAD model for the camera. I plan on making a full CAD when I figure out what parts I'll use. I already have a screen and raspi 4 at home so I have some basic dimensions for that.

## May 18th: Updating CAD

Didn't do too much today, just focused on updating the CAD model based on how the first CAD printed. Found some issues with clearance and fitting the Raspi in the actual shell. I revamp the inside to have a notch for the raspi and enough room for wires, buttons, proto boards, etc. Anyways, I still need to work on the actual pull out screen part and battery comparment.

## May 25th: Arm In CAD

Today I wanted to get the arm part with the hinge modeled in Fusion. This was my first time modeling a hinge and using the join feature in fusion. I went off a hinge desgin based Maker's Muse's snap hinge in his video "Incredibly Handy 3D Printed Hinges!". I got the hinge to work with a bit of struggle at first, but overall I'm happy with the model. I plan on ptinting out the model one more time to figure out sizing but the only thing left is to find where I'll put the power supply in the case.

## May 30th: Battery holder in CAD + some shopping

I modeled a little case on the end of my camera to hold the batteries and some remodeling on the holes for buttons. I'm still not sure what battery type i'll be using but I'm leaning towards a Li-Po with 5v converter and battery charger PCB like the Adafruit PowerBoost 1000. For the shopping, I think I've decided on using the Waveshare 2in capactice touch display module for my main screen and the 0.85 LCD display module for the viewhole screen. I plan on writing some test scripts just to get the camera working, but I won't be albe to test the displays until I get them.

## June 4th: Battery holder in CAD + some shopping

Today I coded some more on the camera app script by adding in new features to allow button presses to turn on and off the preview. I also worked a bit on the CAD and finally decided on the screen I will use for the camera. I'm going with a 2.4" TFT display since it fit perfectly inside my arm.
