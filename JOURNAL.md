Got in a rough idea of what I want the Camcorder to look like. It is based off the Sony Handy Cam that I have at home.

Today I was just creating the Basic CAD model for the camera. I plan on making a full CAD when I figure out what parts I'll use. I already have a screen and raspi 4 at home so I have some basic dimensions for that.
