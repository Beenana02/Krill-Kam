## May 16th: Sketching
Got in a rough idea of what I want the Camcorder to look like. It is based off the Sony Handy Cam that I have at home.

## May 17th: First CAD & Print
Today I was just creating the Basic CAD model for the camera. I plan on making a full CAD when I figure out what parts I'll use. I already have a screen and raspi 4 at home so I have some basic dimensions for that.

## May 18th: Updating CAD

Didn't do too much today, just focused on updating the CAD model based on how the first CAD printed. Found some issues with clearance and fitting the Raspi in the actual shell. I revamp the inside to have a notch for the raspi and enough room for wires, buttons, proto boards, etc. Anyways, I still need to work on the actual pull out screen part and battery comparment.
